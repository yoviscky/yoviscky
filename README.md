        <h3>Howdy ðŸ‘‹</h3>
        <p>I am a young student developer. I started developing when I wanted to learn how to make a bot to spend my time and learn other things, and since then it has become like a second passion that has led me to do more than just Discord, so i'm currently learning HTML (and accidentally CSS). I hope I can create content that helpsðŸ™‚.</p>
